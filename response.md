# Difference between expected value and mean

The mean is calculated over the observations while the expected value is based on probabilities, concretely a weighted mean of
the values with their probability. The mean is part of descriptive statistics and expected value part of the probability.

# The problem w/ P-Values

In datasets that obviously give us information and can demonstrate different things, P-values tell us they are "statistically non-significant" as we look for high confidence intervals and this makes us reject a lot of hypothesis that could be true. In this way we are not assuming risks but also we are in a high probablity we are dismissing hypothesis that can be true.

# A/B testing

For example, taking the subject to the sector I know, law firms: If we were to change the commmunication channel with the customers from email to WhatsApp, instead of forcing all customers and lawyers to share the information about their case through WhatsApp, we could take a sample of the 20 % of the cases and after a few time make a poll. In this poll we would ask the customers as well as the lawyers to rate the communication between the firm and the clients. If the answers from our sample are good, we could switch the communication channel for all customers, otherwise we may go back to email and the loss wouldn't be as big as if we changed everything at once.
