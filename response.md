# Difference between expected value and mean

The mean is calculated over the observations while the expected value is based on probabilities, concretely a weighted mean of
the values with their probability. The mean is part of descriptive statistics and expected value part of the probability.

# The problem w/ P-Values

In datasets that obviously give us information and can demonstrate different things, P-values tell us they are "statistically non-significant" as we look for high confidence intervals and this makes us reject a lot of hypothesis that could be true. In this way we are not assuming risks but also we are in a high probablity we are dismissing hypothesis that can be true.
